<details>

<summary>Working with Refs & Portals [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed (it was previously named "Diving Deeper: Working with Fragments, Portals & Refs"). Fragments are no longer covered in the (updated) section content (since they are covered in the "React Essentials" sections now).

Added new lectures in front of old lectures, separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart the section, otherwise simply continue with it (i.e., ignore the new lectures).

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly).

You should mark the lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures that were added at the beginning of this section but you don't have to.

<summary>Practice Project: Project Management App (with Components, State, Refs & More) [NEW]</summary>

#### What changed?

This is a brand-new section with a brand-new demo app.

If you're already past this section, feel free to explore it and take it as an extra practice opportunity (you don't have to, though).

<details>

<summary>React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management [NEW]</summary>

#### What changed?

This is a brand-new section, covering React's Context API.

Previously, this was covered in the next section after this section (which was named "Advanced: Handling Side Effects, Using Reducers & Using the Context API" and is now named just "Handling Side Effects with useEffect").
That section has been split up into two sections - this section here and the next section (i.e., the old, existing section which now also contains new content).

If you're already past this and the next section, you can ignore this (and the next) section. If you're currently in the next section (i.e., in the "Handling Side Effects with useEffect" section), you may want to restart with this section here (you don't have to though - see the details for the next section).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Handling Side Effects with useEffect [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed and split up (see below). It was previously named "Advanced: Handling Side Effects, Using Reducers & Using the Context API".

This section was split up into two separate sections:
- (1) "React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management" - the section before this section here
- (2) "Handling Side Effects with useEffect" - this section

(1) contains only new lectures, (2) is this old section, which now contains both new and old lectures. New lectures were added in front of the old lectures, separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved** (just split up into two sections)!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart by going to the new "React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management" section, otherwise simply continue with this section and the old lectures in there (i.e., ignore the new lectures).

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly).

You should mark the lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new lectures, including the ones in the newly added second section, or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures in both sections this section was split into.

<summary>Practice Project: Building a Quiz App [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed since we're now building a different demo / practice app (it was previously named "Practice Project: Building a Food Order App").

Added new lectures (→ Quiz app) in front of old lectures (→ Food order app), separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved!**!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart the section, otherwise simply continue with it (i.e., ignore the new lectures). You can also go through both the new and old lectures to build two practice apps.

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly).

You should mark any lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures that were added at the beginning of this section but you don't have to.

<summary>A Look Behind The Scenes Of React & Optimizing Techniques [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

Replaced the lecture videos of this section with new videos. The old content was removed right away to make room for the update since this was a very short section anyways.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

Simply restart the section (it's a pretty short section, hence I took this approach).

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures that were added at the beginning of this section but you don't have to.

<summary>Practice Project: "Building a Food Order App [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed since we're now building a different demo / practice app (it was previously named "Practice Project: Adding Http & Forms To The Food Order App").

We now build a "Food Order" app from scratch in this section (instead of enhancing the old one which was built in an earlier section).

Added the new lectures (→ "Food Order" app from scratch) in front of the old lectures (→ enhancing the old "Food Order" app), separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart the section, otherwise simply continue with it (i.e., ignore the new lectures).

If you haven't started this section yet, you can ignore the old app - going through those old lectures only makes sense if you also built the first version of that old "Food Order" app in an earlier course section.

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly). 

You should mark the lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

## FAQs

<details>

<summary id="faq-how-to-get-update">How do I get the update?</summary>

It's free! I added brand-new lectures to the existing course. So if you're a student of this course, you can access those lectures.

To find out how you should proceed, take a look at my [progress-dependent guidelines](#how-should-you-proceed) before you then explore the [section-specific guidelines](#section-by-section-guide-on-what-changed--how-to-continue).

</details>

<details>

<summary id="faq-how-to-fix-course-progress">What happens with my course progress?</summary>

Unfortunately, Udemy gives me no great course updating tools, hence I have to provide updates by adding new lectures into existing courses.

This does affect your course progress since new lectures are added.

You can always mark lectures as "Completed" manually though - this allows you to quickly adjust the course progress such that it correctly reflects your actual progress.

</details>

<details>

<summary id="faq-how-to-continue">What does this update mean for me? How should I continue?</summary>

React itself did not change, so you don't have to restart the course or do anything like that.

How you can get the most out of this update simply depends on your current course progress.

Therefore, as a first step, take a look at my [progress-dependent guidelines](#how-should-you-proceed) before you then explore the [section-specific guidelines](#section-by-section-guide-on-what-changed--how-to-continue).

<summary id="faq-keep-old-content-around-longer">Can you keep the old content around for a longer period?</summary>

Unfortunately, Udemy gives me no great course updating tools, hence I have to provide updates by adding new lectures into existing courses.

Of course, this can cause some confusion, mess with course progress and bloat the course. That's why I'm only keeping the old, outdated content around for a limited time period (until December 11th 2023).

But I don't remove it instantly, because I want to allow existing students to finish the section(s) they are currently working on.

Therefore, I'm trying to find a good balance between removing the old content too early and too late. If it turns out that a significant number of students is still using the "old" content by the time I want to remove it, I'll probably prolong the transition period by a few weeks (until mid-January 2024). Otherwise, the content gets removed by December 11th 2023.
